        <h4> I am from University of North Carolina at Charlotte. UNCC is a very big campus, and I would say it is the biggest in town.
           There are a diverse section of courses being offered at UNC Charlotte, both for undergrads as well as Master's students.
           Charlotte in general is a beautiful city, which is quite and a happy place. The weather is not so harsh and it's usually pretty warm.
           Charlotte is also famous for a lot of museums, so if you haven't been to Charlotte yet, pack your bags and plan a trip soon... :p  </h4>
